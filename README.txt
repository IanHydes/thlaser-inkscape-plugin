This Inkscape extension is derived from THLaser. It converts paths to gcode for laser cutting. Unlike THLaser, ShinyLaser allows you to set different feedrates for traversal and cut moves. The gcode output is intended to be run on a laser cutter running Smoothieware.

I've modified this extension to work with inkscape v0.91.
It previously worked with my K40 chinese laser using a ramps board but upgrading inkscape screwed it all up.
Dan Beaven's blog, http://3dprintzothar.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/40-watt-chinese-co2-laser-upgrade-with.html
and Jermey's work on http://weistekengineering.com/
have been a major inspiration in upgrading the laser, ajf's move between cuts feed rate is an excellent mod.
